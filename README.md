# GetStarted-Deploy-IBM-Cloud

# Work in progress...

Welcome to my "Get Started" series!

In this repository I am going to reuse my previous code from "GetStarted-TypeScript-Express-React" and show with detailed steps how to deploy this code into the cloud.

I have chosen IBM Cloud as no credit card or pre-information is needed in order to register or start working with it.

The guide can also orient new cloud users, or users which would like to learn more about how to work with cloud platforms a quick start.
